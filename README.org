A compilation of libraries, color palettes, themes, etc. that I commonly use doing data analysis in =R=.

Includes
- =color_palettes.R=: Color blind-friendly color palettes for plotting with =ggplot2=, inspired by the [[http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/][Cookbook for R]].
- =convert_mat_df.R=: Used for converting matrices to ``tidy'' format for use with =ggplot2=
- =imagesc.R=: Visualize matrices similar to Matlab's =imagesc= function using =ggplot2=
- =libraries.R=: Commonly used libraries for convenient loading
- =list_installed_packages.R=: Show user-installed =R= packages
- =load_libraries.R=: One-liner to load libraries in =libraries.R=
- =my_theme.R=: Minor theme customizations for =ggplot2=
- =se.R=: Convenient function for computing standard error (surprisingly not in base =R=?)
